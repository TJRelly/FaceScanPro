# SmartBrain

Smart Brain is a web app that uses the Clarifai API to locate a face in a picture. This face-recognition app uses the following technologies:

- [MERN stack](https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack): MongoDB, Express, React, and Node
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/): CSS Framework for the styles
- [React-Parallax-Tilt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-parallax-tilt): For tilting animation on logo
- [Particles-BG](https://www.npmjs.com/package/particles-bg): For background animation

### Changes to original ZTM-project: 
- Multiple-Face Detection
- Redesign incorporating Tailwind inspired by [Markelca](https://github.com/MarkelCA/smart-brain)

### Challenges: 
This ZTM project was not a straight forward tutorial. The original project uses deprecated components that the learner is expected to correct. The API documentation had completely changed since the making of the original project. I was able to implement the face detection after after extensively searching the internet for answers. Using the same process, I incorporated multiple-face detection as oposed to the single face detection of the original project. Additionally, I selected different npm components based on ease of use, clarity of documentation, and cleaness of code.  These factors should make maintanence easier and quicker.

 *Coming soon:*
- [ ] Node & Express Backend server to manage the users.
- [ ] MongoDB database to store the user's info.
