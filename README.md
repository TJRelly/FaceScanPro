# Smart Brain - Face Recognition

[Smart Brain](https://tjrelly.github.io/smart-brain/) is a web app that uses the Clarifai API to locate a face in a picture. This face-recognition app uses the following technologies:

- [MERN stack](https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack): MongoDB, Express, React, and Node
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/): CSS Framework for the styles
- [React-Parallax-Tilt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-parallax-tilt): for tilting animation on logo
- [Particles-BG](https://www.npmjs.com/package/particles-bg): For background animation
- [Node JS] (https://nodejs.org/en/): for back-end server
- [PostresSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/): for database
- [Render](https://render.com/): for server hosting
- [Neon](https://neon.tech/): for database hosting

### Project Improvements: 
- Multiple-Face Detection
- Redesign incorporating Tailwind inspired by [Markelca](https://github.com/MarkelCA/smart-brain)

### Challenges: 
The original project uses deprecated components that the learner is expected to correct. The API documentation had completely changed since the making of the original project. I was able to implement the face detection after after extensively searching the internet for answers. Using the same process, I incorporated multiple-face detection as oposed to the single face detection of the original project. Additionally, I selected different npm components based on ease of use, clarity of documentation, and cleaness of code.  These factors should make maintanence easier and quicker.
