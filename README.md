# SmartBrain

Smart Brain is a web app that uses the Clarifai API to locate a face in a picture. This face-recognition app uses the following technologies:

- [MERN stack](https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack): MongoDB, Express, React, and Node
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/): As CSS Framework for the styles
- [react-tilty](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-tilty): For the tiling [animation](https://codesandbox.io/s/73rqoq599j?fontsize=14&file=/src/index.js:0-27) on the logo
- [particles.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-tsparticles): For the background [animations](https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/) and interactivity.

### Changes to original ZTM-project: 
- Multiple-Face Detection
- Redesign incorporating Tailwind inspired by [Markelca](https://github.com/MarkelCA/smart-brain)

*Coming soon:*
- [ ] Node & Express Backend server to manage the users.
- [ ] MongoDB database to store the user's info.

### Challenges: 
This ZTM project was not a straight forward tutorial. The original project uses deprecated components that the learner is expected to correct. The API documentation had completely changed since the making of the original project. I was able to implement the face detection after after extensively searching the internet for answers. Using the same process, I incorporated multiple-face detection as oposed to the single face detection of the original project. Additionally, I selected different npm components based on ease of use, clarity of documentation, and cleaness of code.  These factors should make maintanence easier and quicker.
