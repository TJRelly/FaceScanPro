# FaceScanPro

[FaceScanPro](https://tjrelly.github.io/smart-brain/) is a web app that uses the Clarifai API to locate a face in a picture. This face-recognition app uses the following technologies:

- [MERN stack](https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack): Express JS, React JS, and Node JS
- [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/): for back-end server - code posted here: [Smart-Brain-Api](https://github.com/TJRelly/smart-brain-api)
- [PostresSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/): for database
- [Render](https://render.com/): server and database hosting
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/): CSS Framework for the styles
- [React-Parallax-Tilt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-parallax-tilt): for tilting animation on logo
- [Particles-BG](https://www.npmjs.com/package/particles-bg): For background animation

### Project Improvements: 
- Multiple-Face Detection
- Loading Screen
- Redesign incorporating Tailwind inspired by [Markelca](https://github.com/MarkelCA/smart-brain)

### Challenges: 
During the course of this project, I encountered and successfully addressed significant challenges that arose from utilizing deprecated components and adapting to transformed API documentation. I took the initiative to rectify the deprecated components, ensuring the project's compliance with current industry standards. Additionally, I invested substantial effort in researching and comprehending the updated API documentation, allowing for seamless integration with the existing codebase. By implementing face detection, I expanded the project's functionality, going beyond the single face detection capability of the original version. Furthermore, I carefully selected npm components based on criteria such as ease of use, clarity of documentation, and clean code practices. These considerations ensure improved maintainability and expedite future development processes.

Throughout this project, I have demonstrated my resilience, adaptability, and resourcefulness as a software engineer. By addressing deprecated components, adapting to changing API documentation, and enhancing functionality, I have showcased my ability to overcome challenges and deliver high-quality results. This experience has enriched my skills and positioned me to contribute effectively in future projects requiring problem-solving, research, and meticulous decision-making.
